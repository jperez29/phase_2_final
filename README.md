### What are infectious Diseases?

Infectious Diseases are diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms - such as parasites, viruses, or bacteria.

They can be spread, indirectly or directly (vector-borne), from animals to humans, and from person to another.

When the immune system of a host is fully functional, disease symptoms may not develop whenever an infectious organism attacks it. But, if the host immune system is compromised, or the infectious organism overwhelms the immune system, an infectious disease may take over the host's immune system. 

The discovery of antibiotics has helped slow down the spread of infectious diseases, but the misused and overused of them are creating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is critical to keep track of infectious diseases as they are a major public health problem.
